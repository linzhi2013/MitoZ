- **Distribute my working MitoZ environment using [Conda-Pack](https://github.com/linzhi2013/MitoZ/wiki/Installation#2-conda-pack) to try to avoid the missing Perl module problem. It is worth a try if you have the missing Perl module problem!**

**Bugs and Questions**
- Have a look at https://github.com/linzhi2013/MitoZ/issues and https://github.com/linzhi2013/MitoZ/wiki/Known-issues for known bugs or issues.

- **Please try the latest version first if you find some bugs in the old versions**
	- to do that, you should specify the version of MitoZ when you use the `mamba/conda` command (please refer to the [installation instruction](https://github.com/linzhi2013/MitoZ/wiki/Installation)), as I found out that many people still download the older versions.

- _I have been updating the documentation from time to time, so it may be good for you to check the documentation again every after some time._

- In case there are still bugs in the latest version, please **firstly search https://github.com/linzhi2013/MitoZ/issues** and the Wiki to check whether similar questions have been raised by other users. If no related issues and answers are found, then please raise a new issue. Thank you!

- Any feedbacks are wellcome!
