# Manual of MitoZ

# 1. About MitoZ

MitoZ is a Python3-based toolkit which aims to automatically filter pair-end raw data (fastq files), assemble genome, search for mitogenome sequences from the genome assembly result, annotate mitogenome (genbank file as result), and mitogenome visualization. MitoZ is available from `https://github.com/linzhi2013/MitoZ`.


# 2. System requirment

## 2.1 Platform

MitoZ is developed and tested under `Linux version 2.6.32-696.el6.x86_64 (mockbuild@c1bm.rdu2.centos.org) (gcc version 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-18) (GCC) ) #1 SMP Tue Mar 21 19:29:05 UTC 2017`.

## 2.2 Harddisk space

\>10 GB

## 2.3 Memory

It takes ~100G when we tested MitoZ with `--thread_number 16`. This is because MitoZ uses the *de Bruijn* graph (DBG) algorithm to perform *de novo* assembly. To learn more, see https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btu077.

there are ways to reduce the memory usage:
1. enrich the mitochondrion during experiment step (e.g. via gene capture array).
  This can lead to a higher mitochondrial derived reads ratio in the HTS data, and then you can use less data for MitoZ input,
which can reduce memory usage of MitoZ.

2. filter out the mitochondrial reads by mapping reads against mitogenomes of closely-related species (if any).
  provide such reads (a smaller volume of data) to MitoZ.

**Warning**:
Use too many threads (e.g. > 16) can be problematic, the assembly step can get stuck and seems never finished.  

# 3. Get started

MitoZ includes multiple modules, including `all`, `all2`, `filter`, `assemble`, `findmitoscaf`, `annotate` and `visualize`.

**Important: make sure you are in the `mitozEnv` environment when you run MitoZ!**

    $ source activate mitozEnv

see `INSTALL.md` for installation instruction.


Now create a directory for one sample:

    $ mkdir ~/example
    $ cd ~/example

# 4. Data requirement

## 4.1 Material source

The most preferable data for mitochondrial genome assembly is always data with high
ratio of mitochondrial derived reads and little contamination. For example, tissue samples
may be better than blood samples or gut samples.

## 4.2 Requirment of data size and insert size

About 1.5 to 3G base pair (bp) is enough for mitochondrial genome assembly.

e.g. `raw.1.fq.gz` and `raw.2.fq.gz` or `clean.1.fq.gz` and `clean.2.fq.gz`

The read length should be >= 71bp (PE71). Typically, I use data of PE100 or PE150 sequencing.

The length of read1 and read2 must be equal. You should trim your data (e.g. use the option `--keep_region` in `filter` function of MitoZ) before running MitoZ.

The insert size of pair-end library should be small insert size (<1000 bp). I do not recommend to use data of large insert size (>1000bp, mate-pair library), because this kind of data usually is not good as small insert size data.


## 4.3 Data pretreatment

MitoZ supports simple data pretreatment (remove low quality, many Ns reads, duplications),
thus you can provide MitoZ the raw data (fastq files) from WGS experiments directly.
In this case, you can use the `all` or `filter` module to perform data filtering.

Or, you can provide MitoZ the clean data, which have been filtered by other tools.

## 4.4 Modules support both single-end data and pair-end data

* `all`

* `all2`

* `filter`

* `assemble`

* `annotate`

* `visualize`

**NB:  since single-end data lacks pairing information that is useful in the scaffolding step,
it may not be able to generate mitochondrial genome assembly of quality as good as that
generated using paired-end data.**

## 4.5 Modules support pair-end data only

* `findmitoscaf`(needs fastq only when the input assembly (containing nuclear and mitochondrial sequences) is not from SOAPdenovo-Trans or mitoAssemble, to caculate the sequence sequencing depth)


## 4.6 Fasta file

When you annotate a mitogenome sequence(s) stored in fasta file, the sequence id can not be too long, or MitoZ will fail. This is for some limitation in BioPython that MitoZ invokes.


## 4.7 Genetic code

It is important to set a correct genetic code for MitoZ (`--genetic_code` option). Usually, arthropods use the invertebrate mitochondrial code (`--genetic_code 5`), and mammals use the vertebrate mitochondrial code (`--genetic_code 2`).Please refer to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Utils/wprintgc.cgi for more details.

MitoZ use the genetic code for annotating the Protein coding genes (PCGs) of mitochondrial genome.


## 4.8 Taxa group

It is also important to set a correct taxa group for MitoZ (`--clade` option).

MitoZ use the `--clade` option to choose corresponding database (HMM modules, CM modules, protein reference sequences).

# 5. Supporting for specifying parameters in a configure file

Now MitoZ supports use a configure file to set the parameter, besides using the command
line way (as the examples in the later sections).

## 5.1 create a configure file for desired module

For example,

    $ python3 MitoZ.py all --create_config

will a file `mitoz_all_config.txt`, which contains the paramters same as output by `python3 MitoZ.py all -h`.

Then modify the file `mitoz_all_config.txt` as the instructions in the file.


*The example configure file for each module has also been placed in the directory `example_configure_files/`*



## 5.2 run the module

    $ python3 MitoZ.py all --config mitoz_all_config.txt


# 6. `all` module

`all` module supports pair-end data and single-end data.

`all` module requires only two input pair-end fastq files, and outputs a genbank file containing mitochondrial genome sequences and annotation information.

Internally, `all` module runs `filter`, `assemble`, `findmitoscaf`, `annotate` and `visualize` module sequentially, which really makes MitoZ an "on-click" solution for mitogenome analysis from raw HTS data.

## 6.1 Input files

Pair-end(PE) fastq files (`raw.1.fq.gz` and `raw.2.fq.gz`), and optional files `1.adapter.list.gz` and `2.adapter.list.gz`.

## 6.2 Example

    $ python3 MitoZ.py all --genetic_code 5 --clade Arthropoda --outprefix ZZZ \
    --thread_number 12 \
    --fastq1 raw.1.fq.gz \
    --fastq2 raw.2.fq.gz \
    --fastq_read_length 150 \
    --insert_size 250  \
    --run_mode 2 \
    --filter_taxa_method 1 \
    --requiring_taxa 'Arthropoda'

For more details, please refer to `python3 MitoZ.py all -h`

            └── README.txt

The intermediate files are in the `tmp` directory, and `ZZZ.result` contains the result files
for your sample.

Files in `ZZZ.result` including:

<br>

1. `README.txt`

A brief instruction about each file in the `ZZZ.result` directory.

<br>

2. `summary.txt`
 
A summary about the mitogenome in `ZZZ_mitoscaf.fa.gbf` (or the `*.mitogenome.fa` file
if you run `assemble` or `findmitoscaf` module), including a list of genes,
numbers of genes recovered totally, what genes may be missing (if any), the sequence length,
circularity, most closely related species.

<br>

3. `circos.png` and `circos.svg`

Visualizations of the mitogenome in `ZZZ_mitoscaf.fa.gbf`.

<br>

4. `ZZZ_mitoscaf.fa.gbf`, `ZZZ.fasta`, `ZZZ_mitoscaf.fa.sqn` and `ZZZ_mitoscaf.fa.tbl`.

The mitogenome files in different format. **The sequences whose sequence ids have
`_FivePCGs` suffixs (if any) are not considered as our mitogenome of target species,
and they are output intendedly for further inspection by users**. All sequences with ≥ 5
PCGs besides the mitochondrial sequences will be output by MitoZ intendedly.

If you run the `assemble` or `findmitoscaf` modules, the `ZZZ.fasta` file will be `work71.mitogenome.fa`.
We do not rename `work71.mitogenome.fa` to be `ZZZ.fasta` to aovid overwriting the `ZZZ.fasta` file if you run
MitoZ in multi-kmer mode.


<br>

5. `ZZZ.cds`, `ZZZ.rrna`, `ZZZ.trna` and `ZZZ.misc_feature`

The individual gene sequences in fasta format, extracted from `ZZZ_mitoscaf.fa.gbf`.

<br>

6. `ZZZ_mitoscaf.fa.val` and `errorsummary.val`

The two files are generated by NCBI's tbl2asn program, describing related warnings and
errors for file `ZZZ_mitoscaf.fa.gbf`. Thus, **you should check this file to confirm if
there are any assembly or annotation problems**.

For example, an InternalStop for protein coding genes can be caused by assemlby (e.g.,
there are Ns, or assembly errors), annotation, mutation, incorrect genetic code, or the
sequence simply comes from nuclear mitochondrial DNA segments (NUMTs). You may inspect
the sequencing depth distribution of sequences around such regions from the
visualization result files (`circos.png` and `circos.svg`).

<br>

7. `work71.mitogenome.fa` and `work71.most_related_species.txt`

The mitogenome sequences from each kmer (e.g. kmer 71) assembly and their most closely
related species.

* If you run `all` or `all2` module, you can ignore the two files, `work71.mitogenome.fa` is
the same as `ZZZ.fasta` file, while `work71.most_related_species.txt` is the same as
`ZZZ.most_related_species.txt`.

* If you run `assemble` or `findmitoscaf` module, the `work71.mitogenome.fa` or
`outprefix.mitogenome.fa` is your mitogenome file.

* If you run MitoZ in multi-kmer mode, if one kmer assembly has very good results, then you
can just use these two files as your mitogenome files, instead of the file
`outprefix.multiKmer_seq_picked.clean.fa` (describled in **section 13.1** as below)

<br>

*Below file are not part of the final mitogenome results, but are output just in case the
users want to know more about those information instead of the mitogeome of target species*.

8. `work71.hmmtblout.besthit.sim.filtered.high_abundance_10.0X.reformat.sorted.Not-picked`, `work71.hmmtblout.besthit.sim.filtered.high_abundance_10.0X.reformat.sorted.Not-picked.fa`, `work71.hmmtblout.besthit.sim.filtered.low_abundance` and `work71.hmmtblout.besthit.sim.filtered.low_abundance.fasta`

These `*.low_abundance*` and `*.high_abundance*` files, which are the sequences with low abundances
or high abundances but not selected as outputs by MitoZ.

*These sequences, together with the sequences whose sequence ids have `_FivePCGs` suffixs in
`ZZZ_mitoscaf.fa.gbf` and `ZZZ.fasta` (if any), may be useful if, for
example, you want to find potential NUMTs, or want to know if there are some sequences
of non-target-species*.

<br>

When you use other modules, some of those files (directories) may be absent.


# 7 `all2` module

`all2` module supports single-end data and pair-end data.

`all2` is amolst the same as `all`, except that `all2` doesn't filter the input fastq files.

Internally, `all2` module runs `assemble`, `findmitoscaf`, `annotate` and `visualize` module sequentially.

# 8. `filter` module

`filter` module supports pair-end data and single-end data.

`filter` is to filter input raw fastq files (`raw.1.fq.gz` and `raw.2.fq.gz`), outputs clean fastq files (`clean.1.fq.gz` and `clean.2.fq.gz`)

## 8.1 Input files
Pair-end(PE) fastq files (`raw.1.fq.gz` and `raw.2.fq.gz`), and optional files `1.adapter.list.gz` and `2.adapter.list.gz`.

# 9. `assemble` module

`assemble` module supports single-end data and pair-end data.

`assemble` is to assemble `clean.1.fq.gz` and `clean.2.fq.gz`, search for mitochondrial sequences from the assembly. Output is a mitochondrial sequence file in fasta format.

Internally, `assemble` module will assemble the nuclear + mitochondrial genomes firstly with the input fastq
files, then invoke `findmitoscaf` module to find out the mitogeome.

## 9.1 Input files
Pair-end(PE) fastq files (`clean.1.fq.gz` and `clean.2.fq.gz`).

## 9.2 Example

For pair-end data:

# 10. `findmitoscaf` module

`findmitoscaf` module supports pair-end data only.

`findmitoscaf` is to search for the mitochondrial sequences from fasta file which contains non-mitochondrial sequences. Output is a mitochondrial sequence file in fasta format.

## 10.1 Input files

* `work71.scafSeq`

A file contains non-mitochondrial sequences.

If `work71.scafSeq` is generated by SOAPdenovo-Trans or mitoAssemble, you can specify the option `--from_soaptrans`, and in this case, `work71.scafSeq` is the only input file you need.

Otherwise, you still need following two files as input,

* `clean.1.fq.gz` and `clean.2.fq.gz`


## 10.2 Example

    $ python3 MitoZ.py findmitoscaf --genetic_code 5 --clade Arthropoda --outprefix test \
    --thread_number 8 \
    --from_soaptrans \
    --fastafile work71.scafSeq

Or,

    $ python3 MitoZ.py findmitoscaf --genetic_code 5 --clade Arthropoda \
    --outprefix test --thread_number 8 \
    --fastq1 clean.1.fq.gz \
    --fastq2 clean.2.fq.gz \
    --fastq_read_length 150 \
    --fastafile work71.scafSeq


# 11. `annotate` module

`annotate` module supports single-end and pair-end data.

`annotate` is to annotate the input mitogenome sequence, including protein coding genes (PCGs), tRNA genes and rRNA genes. Output is a genbank file containing mitochondrial genome sequences and annotation information.

## 11.1 Input files
e.g. `mitogenome.fa`

A fasta file containing the mitochondrial seqeunces.

## 11.2 Example

    $ python3 MitoZ.py annotate --genetic_code 5 --clade Arthropoda \
    --outprefix test --thread_number 8 \
    --fastafile mitogenome.fa


If you want to see the abundance along the mitogenome sequences, you will also need to set `--fastq1` and/or `--fastq2`.

# 12. `visualize` module

`visualize` module supports single-end and pair-end data.

`visualize` module is to visualize the genbank file.

## 12.1 Input files
e.g. `mitogenome.gb`

A Genbank file.

## 12.2 Example

    $ python3 MitoZ.py visualize --gb mitogenome.gb

If you want to show sequencing depth along the mitogenome, you need to set `--fastq1` and/or `--fastq2` or `--depth`.


# 13. Multi-Kmer mode
when there are missing PCGs after you run MitoZ in quick mode (`--run_mode 2`), you can try with the multi-Kmer mode (`--run_mode 3`).

You should provide the quick mode assembly as input, including files:

1. `work71.hmmout.fa`, or a file (e.g. `quickMode.fa`) which you convince containing the correct mitogenome sequences for your sample. And manually create a file (e.g. `quick_mode_fa_genes.txt`) describing what PCG genes on each sequence, format:

        seqid1 PCG1 PCG2
        seqid2 PCG3

2. `work71.hmmtblout.besthit.sim.filtered.fa`

3. `work71.hmmtblout.besthit.sim.filtered.high_abundance_*X.reformat.sorted`

in the directory of `outprefix.assembly`.

## 13.1 Example

    $ python3 MitoZ.py all2 --genetic_code 5 --clade Arthropoda --outprefix test \
    --thread_number 12 --fastq1 clean.1.fq.gz --fastq2 clean.2.fq.gz \
    --fastq_read_length 150 --insert_size 250 \
    --run_mode 3 \
    --filter_taxa_method 1 \
    --requiring_taxa 'Arthropoda' \
    --quick_mode_seq_file quickMode.fa \
    --quick_mode_fa_genes_file quick_mode_fa_genes.txt  \
    --missing_PCGs ND4L ND6 ND2 \
    --quick_mode_score_file work71.hmmtblout.besthit.sim.filtered.high_abundance_10.0X.reformat.sorted  \
    --quick_mode_prior_seq_file work71.hmmtblout.besthit.sim.filtered.fa

The result file is `outprefix.multiKmer_seq_picked.clean.fa` under directory `outprefix.assembly2`.


# 14. Rearrangement of mitogenome basing on reference mitogeome

use the script `useful_scripts/Mitogenome_reorder.py` manually.

Reorder your mitochondrial genome sequence so as to be same with
your reference. this is potenially needed becasue assember do not
break mitogenome in "0" position for some reasons.

Additionally, you can give a set of primer which is close to 0
position of mitogenome, (e.g. F15: CACCCTATTAACCACTCACG for human)
so I can use this information to adjust the sequence order.

It supports three modes: (i). -f, using a reference guide; (ii).
-p, using a human mitogenome primer set in a certain list(F15 or
F361). However, it assumes that your primer is identical to
sequence, complementary or reverse primer not acceptable!

If your mitogenome is circular, final reordered mitogenoem will be
merely adjusted link orientation, if not, program will add 100 N
between portions.


## 14.1 Usage

    $ python3 Mitogenome_reorder.py  -f mito.fasta -r ref.fasta
    $ python3 Mitogenome_reorder.py  -f mito.fasta -p L15

## 14.2 Optional arguments:

      -h, --help  show this help message and exit
      -f FILE     your mitogenome fasta
      -r FILE     reference fasta
      -p STR      primer set for [F15, F361], this is only for human
      -m INT      mismatch threshod for primer anchoring


## 14.3 Tips

- Make sure you sequence ID contains "topology=circular" or "topology=linear", this is important!
- If you want to use your own sequnce as primer bait, you can modify this python script, add you priemr sequence as a pair of KEY-VALUSE to dict of "primers", and make sure the numer is accurate, e.g. F15 means that primer starts at 15th base in sequnce.
- Primer sequence can contain a degenerate base, like R, Y, M ...


# 15. Other useful scripts

## 15.1 To handle a Genbank file

        $ python3 circle_check.py

        Description

            Checking whether the sequences are circular when the sequences have
            length >= 12Kbp

        Usage

            python3 circle_check.py  <in.fasta>  <outPrefix> <mismatch_allowed>

        output files:

        1. <outPrefix>.mitogenome.fa
        All the sequences from <in.fasta>.

        The sequence id line will be like:
        >C1 topology=circular
        >C2 topology=linear

        For the circular mt sequence, the overlapping region (the second `ATGCNN`
        below) has been removed (below is an example)

        ATGCNNNNN[ATGCNN]

        Assuming `ATGCNNNNN` is a circular mt sequence, `ATGCNN` are the overlapping
        regions.

        2. <outPrefix>.start2end_for-circular-mt-only
        This file contains the circular sequences only, and the first 300 bp of each
        has been moved to the end of the sequence, just for better reads mapping. You
        can check the sequencing depth around the 'joining site' (-300 bp) using the
        `annotate` module of MitoZ, to confirm if the sequence is really circular.

        3. <outPrefix>.overlap_information
        The overlapping sequence detected for the circular sequences.


## 15.3 Extract gene sequences from Genbak file

use the script `useful_scripts/gbseqextractor_v2.py`.


	usage: gbseqextractor_v2.py [-h] -f <STR> -prefix <STR> [-seqPrefix <STR>]
	                         [-types {CDS,rRNA,tRNA,wholeseq} [{CDS,rRNA,tRNA,wholeseq} ...]]
	                         [-gi] [-p] [-t] [-s] [-l] [-rv] [-F]

	extract any CDS or rNRA or tRNA DNA sequences of genes from Genbank file.
	Note: the position on ID line is 1-leftmost! Seqid will be the value of
	'/gene=' or '/product=', if they both were not present, the gene will not be
	output!

	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  -f <STR>              Genbank file
	  -prefix <STR>         prefix of output file.
	  -seqPrefix <STR>      prefix of each seq id. default: None
	  -types {CDS,rRNA,tRNA,wholeseq} [{CDS,rRNA,tRNA,wholeseq} ...]
	                        what kind of genes you want to extract? wholeseq for
	                        whole fasta seq.[CDS]
	  -gi                   use gi number as sequence ID instead of accession
	                        number when gi number is present. (default: accession
	                        number)
	  -p                    output the position information on the ID line.
	                        1-leftmost, same as in the Genbank file. [False]
	  -t                    output the taxonomy lineage on ID line [False]
	  -s                    output the species name on the ID line [False]
	  -l                    output the seq length on the ID line [False]
	  -rv                   reverse and complement the sequences if the gene is on
	                        minus strand [False]
	  -F                    only output full length genes [False]


# 16. How good is my result?

There are several aspects you should consider:

1. The sequencing depth along the mitochondrial sequence(s)

Check the `circos.png` or `circos.svg` files

2. Internal stop codons within PCGs

3. Circularity of your mitochondrial sequence

Check the `summary.txt`

4. Is there any gene missing?

Sometimes, even when the result mitogenome is complete ('circular'), due to the limitation of annotation progrom, e.g., MiTFi for tRNA, some tRNA genes can still be missing.

5. Can my result sequences be contaminations or NUMTs?

Blast your result sequences again NCBI NT database.
